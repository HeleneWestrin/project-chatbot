# Harmoniqa â€“ Where mood meets melody

The project was to create an interactive Chatbot that manipulates the DOM when the user replies by using functions, conditionals and event listeners.

## The problem

Describe how you approached to problem, and what tools and techniques you used to solve it. How did you plan? What technologies did you use? If you had more time, what would be next?

For this project, I approached the problem by first understanding the structure and flow of the chatbot. I planned out the conversation steps and mapped out how the user would interact with the bot, starting with entering their name and progressing through mood and color choices to receive song suggestions.
