# Harmoniqa â€“ Where mood meets melody

The project was to create an interactive Chatbot that manipulates the DOM when the user replies by using functions, conditionals and event listeners.

## The problem

For this project, I approached the problem by first understanding the structure and flow of the chatbot. I planned out the conversation steps and mapped out how the user would interact with the bot, starting with entering their name and progressing through mood and color choices to receive song suggestions.

I have used functions, event listeners and condtionals statements in order to give a tailored, but dynamic experience to the user.
